# Code Review Checklist for Front-End Developers


The goal is not to define a formal definition of practices for code review but to give some checklist for reviewers. 

Of course, it helps a developer to know how the reviewer does his code review. He can so focus on writing a better and simpler code.

We speak about because the code author doesn't make his own code review. The developer needs a new way. Of course, the developer could continue to refactor his code to improve it.


## Philosophie 


		Code Review is about the code not about the coder.


Basically, the code review focuses only on code written.
 
It's not the time to blame the author but to verify that the code meets the defined standards, best practices... 

It means that no one escapes thec code review: new hire, a senior, the lead developer or even CTO.

**What must be understood is that there is no written well enough to not be seen code.**

This is also the time to share development techniques, tips ... and why not initiate discussions or debate on a particular way of coding.
